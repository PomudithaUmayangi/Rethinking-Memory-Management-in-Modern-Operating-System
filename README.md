# üñ•Ô∏è Rethinking Memory Management in Modern Operating Systems

Welcome to the **Memory Management Exploration Project**!  
This project delves into advanced memory management techniques inspired by the research paper *"Rethinking Memory Management in Modern Operating Systems: Horizontal, Vertical, or Random?"* The study addresses the challenges of managing memory in modern multicore systems, proposing the innovative HVR (Horizontal, Vertical, Random) framework to optimize performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features and Implementations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Key Problems Addressed**
- Inefficient memory access patterns.
- Limited flexibility in memory management.
- Overhead associated with managing multiple applications and dynamic workloads.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Proposed Solutions**
- **Vertical Partitioning:** Divides memory across levels like DRAM and LLC to reduce contention and improve efficiency.
- **Horizontal Partitioning:** Allocates resources within memory levels to minimize interference.
- **Sys-Mon Tool:** Monitors application activities dynamically for real-time optimization.
- **Partitioning & Coalescing:** Optimizes memory usage by dividing and combining memory units.
- **Multi-Policy Framework:** Applies multiple memory management policies simultaneously.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Implementation**
- Developed HVR in the Linux kernel with features like:
  - X-Buddy for physical page indexing.
  - Dynamic partitioning rules to optimize memory for various workloads.
  - Lazy page migration to reduce overhead.
